# React Minesweeper

This is a Minesweeper game written in React. I built this application in order to learn more about React and component based architecture. There is also a live demo available [here](https://dan-koller.github.io/minesweeper/).

## How to play

This game follows the basic principe of the original Minesweeper from Windows (except that you can land on a mine
first try). You can clear, find and flag mines. To reset the field, just click onto the Emoji in the mid.
Have fun playing!
